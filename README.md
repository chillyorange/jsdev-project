# jsdev-project
This file contains specifications for a sample project on which candidate developers should work for 14 days. **We do not expect a polished final product, however the basic functionality should be implemented as per the instructions below**.

#The project
You will be coding a Boostrap drag and drop form builder similar to the one found here: https://kevinchappell.github.io/formBuilder/ Basic functionaly should match that of the sample script. We expect the functionality to be similar as the sample script and to be functioning correctly, however we do not expect a polished final product and it's OK to do the bare minimum in terms of design/aesthetics. To spend as little time as possible on looks/aesthetics, I would suggest using the default Bootstrap design and markup.   

#Technical requirements
* JQuery/jQueryUI can be used when creating the script, but other libraries should not be used.
* The source code should be modular and following the commonjs module pattern.
* Unit tests are not required at this point.
* Copy&pasting source code from the sample project is not allowed.
* The produced code should be placed in a public Github repo.
